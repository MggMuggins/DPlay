# DPlay
A little ASCII block text writer for Linux/Unix with support for multiple fonts and sizes. More fonts are welcome as are more characters from the ASCII set. See "Contributing Fonts". Ideas for support for a multi-platform font system would be appreciated.

# Contributing
Currently wondering if I should include the Code::Blocks files in the repo or not. Clone this repository into a new D Code::Blocks project and configure to contribute currently. Running the fonts install script will be nessasary once it has been completed.

# Contributing Fonts
Each font is stored in a folder inside the fonts folder. Each font folder contiains a file for each character. Multiple fonts are not yet supported.
